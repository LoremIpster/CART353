# Concept
With the flood of technologic experiments, we got so used to try things and then maybe enjoy them for a minutes, or maybe just scoff after a few seconds, but we often never come back. Programs are endlessly renewable and will start anew for every new user. But what if you had to care for your program? What if you had to spend time with it, and nurture it in order to see its full potential?

But why converse with a program? It's code. It doesn't care. But you do. Maybe that conversation your having with that thing is not one way. Maybe it's actually bouncing right back at you. Maybe what is being said is actually useless. However, the act of saying something _is_ important.

That state of correspondence, of letter-writing, of journaling, of having an imaginary friend listening is only a pretext to dare look inwards.

# why it is worthy of exploration
This project aims to confront the user to a _being_ that requires attention, and time, to grow and

# your implementation of these ideas in code.
The letter-writing process will actually be pre-authored letters that the user will type out. I am not interested in the content, but rather in the action of typing keys, and the time spent mashing them.

The time spend will be the resource, and act as the "water" for the _being_, which will either be represented by abstract shapes or something more concrete (like a planet?).

In the same spirit of introspection, the simulation will offer a questionnaire at the beginning that the user will need to fill. Any number of questions can be anwered before the beginning of the simulation, and that number of question answer will have an influence on the shape, size and color of the _being_.


# identify design research questions that were motivating what you have done so far
What it is like to spend time writing long letters that have already been authored?

Can you actually care about a persistent webpage?

Can an abstract being, while growing and / or withering, actually act as a mirror for your feelings?

# identify decisions and new questions that have been informed by your current prototype
* abstract being: abstract shapes

* concrete being: planet
